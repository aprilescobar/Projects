## Description
StyleMe♡ is all about having a library of outfit options. On days when you don't know what to wear,
you can simply log into your StyleMe♡ account, browse through your outfits library, and wear the look you're going for!

For added inspiration, you have the ability to browse other outfits created by other users. You can like and comment any of the 
outfits you see! Once you like an outfit, it's saved in your liked library for you to reference later on! Or you know... unless the 
user decided to delete that outfit... then it'll disappear from your liked library too.

## Description
AprilFitDays was inspired by this pandemic. I don't know about you, but I love doign group fitness workouts! The main reason being, I don't need to think about what moves to do! In group fitness workouts, you just show up, focus on your form and get a good sweat in!

Unfortunately with the pandemic and social distancing, it's a bit of a challenge to hold these sessions. Hence the creation of this app! AprilFitDays is a library of follow-along videos that provides you with a log of your completed workouts.

You also have the abilty to become a creator and contribute to the community by uploading your own follow-along videos!
